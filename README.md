# BrowserFS Process

An emulation of NodeJS's `process` variable. Used in [BrowserFS](https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS).

Currently, this repository is a simple wrapper around functionality provided in the monolithic BrowserFS library.

In the future, the actual source code of BrowserFS's `process` implementation will be moved here.
